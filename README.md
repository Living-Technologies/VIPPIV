# VIPPIV
'Visual Interactive Program for Particle Image Velocimetry'

VIPPIV is a program designed for easy visualization of common preprocessing steps such as morphological dilation and erosison.
It accepts video files and allows the user to change preprocessing steps on the fly with immediate visualization.
Simply upload a video, choose the relevant preprocessing steps and click the [PIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry) analysis button to generate a vector field corresponding to the input video.
When a vector field has been generated several options for saving of results appear as well as a button for the calculation of [Morans Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I)
